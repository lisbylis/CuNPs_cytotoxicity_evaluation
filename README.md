# Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis in our Final Project at Ilum School of Science, titled: "Evaluation of Copper Nanoparticles for Selective Cytotoxicity in In Vitro Metastatic Models."

The notebooks cover a variety of computational workflows, including:

- Materials characterization

- Biological assay analysis

- Statistical analysis

- Other computational methods used throughout the project

These resources aim to provide transparency and reproducibility of the data analysis performed during the study.
